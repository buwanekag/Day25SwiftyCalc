## Day 25 Homework
### SwiftyCalc

Your second project ever was the Inevitable Calculator. Your client came into a little extra cash, and wants you to accomplish 2 things. First, you know a lot more now then you knew then, so they want you to take advantage of all of your knowledge and make the code better/more efficient. Second, they want to future-proof the app by rewriting it in Swift (rather than Objective C).

MINIMUM requirements for this entire assignment:
* It must be written in Swift
* It should look & work the iOS Calculator App
* It must have buttons for numbers 0-9, ., +, -, /, *, =, +/-, % and Clear, plus a Label for the result
* It should look good on all devices & rotations
